### Local Development Setup

To run this project on your local machine, you will need to run the frontend and backend servers in two separate terminals.

#### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create venv
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Flask server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend API will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

#### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create an environment file:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` directory.
    * Populate it with your Firebase project configuration keys:
        ```
        REACT_APP_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
        REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
        REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
        REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
        REACT_APP_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
        ```
4.  **Run the React server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend application will open at `http://localhost:3000`.
